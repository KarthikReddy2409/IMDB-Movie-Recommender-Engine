# IMDB-Movie-Recommender-Engine
This code explains how IMDB rates movies and I've built several recommender systems which provide movie recommendations to the users.
Initially use Weighted average IMDB formula as metric to scale the rating and plotted the best movie with the Weighted Average Rating Score.
Considering popularity of a movie based on the views, plotted the best movie based on popularity.
Later plotted the Best Rated and Most Popular movies Blend at once by creating a SCORE which considers 50% score of Weighted Average Rating of the movies and 50% score of the most popular movies.
Later Built a Recommender System that shares similar plot summaries using TF-IDF.
Computed the Sigmoid Kernel to calculate the numerical quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies and tested the Recommender System with Seminal films.
